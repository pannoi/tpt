# Description

Inside each module, you can find a separate  ```README.md``` in which there will be more fragmented information on a separate module. 

Advice, if some information is not enough or something is not clear, you can report it in ```Discord``` or make a Pull Request in ```GitHub``` to update some documentation for your classmates
